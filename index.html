        <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
        <p>Renewable energy is the energy that comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished, such as wind, 
          water, sunlight, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy can provide clean, reliable and affordable electricity 
          for various purpose such as cooking, lighting and heating. According to the International Renewable Energy 
          Agency (IRENA), renewable energy sources accounted for 28.4% of the global electricity generation in 2021, 
          up from 26.4% in 2020. However, the pace of renewable energy deployment varies across regions and countries, 
          depending on the availability of resources, the level of policy support, the cost of technologies, and the 
          existing infrastructure. In this visualisation, we will explore more about the renewable energy and its sustainability.

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p>In year 2020, most of the countries around the world had reached an average of electricity accessibility above 
          80% of their population. However, there are still some countries that have less than 50% of their population, which 
          mainly located in Africa. This may be due to the lack of infrastructure and poor technologies.

        <h2>Renewable Energy Share vs CO2 emissions per Country (2000-2019)</h2>
        <p>The emissions of CO2 is crucial to the environment as it is one of the main greenhouse gases that contribute to 
          global warming. Some studies believe that increasing the share of renewable energy can lead to lower CO2 emissions. 
          However, the development of the countries and economic structure are also important as they affect the energy demand, 
          supply, and efficiency of each country. The chart below shows the relationship between the share of renewable energy, 
          CO2 emissions, and the country's GDP per capita from year 2000 to 2019.
